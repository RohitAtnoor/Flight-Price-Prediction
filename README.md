‚úà Flight Price üí≤Prediction model using üìà Linear Regression, Decision-tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression!  
This model can predict the price of a flight based on a variety of factors, including the source and destination airports, the üïú  time of departure and arrival, Flight name, and the date of travel  üìÜ .  
To use the model we need to provide the required inputs and it will return a predicted price for the flight. The model has been trained on historical dataset to make predictions.  


## Tools used in building the model

## The project involved the following steps:  

üî¨ Exploratory data analysis (EDA)   
üßπ  Data cleaning  
üõ†Ô∏è  Feature engineering  
üöÄModel building  
üöÄModel deployment  

## The following machine learning models were used:  

Linear regression  
Decision tree Regression  
Random Forest Regression  
Lasso  
Ridge  
Elastic net  

The project was deployed in the Azure Cloud environment for the practice purpose and to learn the Machine learning techiniques in Azure.  

## Learnings  
This project helped me learn about the importance of EDA, feature engineering, and model selection. I also learned how to deploy a machine learning model in the cloud.  

Python programming: I have used Python to write the code for the project, including the EDA, feature engineering, model building, and deployment.  

SQL database querying: I have used SQL to extract the data from the database.   

Flask web development: I have used Flask to create a web app that allows users to predict the price of diamonds. This is a simple web app which takes user input and give the predicted price.  

EDA and feature engineering: With the help of EDA i was able to explore the data and to identify features that could be used to predict the price of diamonds. With the help of feature engineering i was able to analyse the importance of the features for price prediction.  

Machine learning model building and deployment: Based on the analysis as this was a regression problem i have used Linear regression and regularization techniques to built a machine learning model.
